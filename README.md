# galopy
Implementation of genetic algorithm for linear optics quantum gates search

0. I use PyGAD (pip install pygad)
1. Set the search constants to feet your taste directly in galo.py (see below).
2. python galo.py
3. Observe the result!

#  Initialization here!

depth - the number of linear optics gates in the circuit (gate is one of [I, BS, PS]) 

depth = 8

ancillas - how many ancilla modes to add

ancillas = 4

other constants - read the PyGAD guide : https://pygad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README_pygad_ReadTheDocs.html
